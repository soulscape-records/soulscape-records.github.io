# Artist Guidelines
**Some information every Soulscape Artists (or every artist in general) must know**

## 1. Sample & Vocal Usage
You're fine to release an intentionally not copyrighted (better off altered) vocals/sample like from a sample pack or from online resources like **Splice** or from any royalty-free sample packs, rather than using a vocals/sample made intentionally just for a song (if you use it, that would be considered as remix/bootleg and it's NOT acceptable for a release except if it's from our releases AND you have the artist's permission and at least providing us a proof. More on the second paragraph)

You also need to have a license for the vocals/sample, or simply a proof if you have the rights to release it. **If you are using other songs as a sample, ask for a clearance**. For Splice, they could generate the license to use them and send them to the label you wish, an agreement from you and your vocalist, or the proof that you bought the sample pack and the license attached to the pack.

## 2. Artist Appearances 
**Keep your appearance as original as possible**. It's normal for an artist to take their time at least for some weeks for them to make their appearances as good and as original as they possibly can. Elements encompassing cover art, profile pictures, artist galleries, biographical descriptions, artist names, logos, artistic works, performances, and interpersonal engagements are included in this. 

It is strongly discouraged to use AI-generated content for personal appearances, as such a practice can detrimentally impact an artist's reputation within the industry and extend negative consequences to peers. Several noteworthy reasons underline this:
- The vagueness surrounding the source of AI training data, with segments often utilized without creators' explicit consent, poses ethical concerns even for prominent entities such as OpenAI. ([PROOF 1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-sued-for-stealing-data-from-the-public-to-train-chatgpt/) \| [PROOF 2](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chatgpt-generative-ai-stole-personal-data-lawsuit-children-medical-2023-6))
- Using AI-generated content for personal appearances is unacceptable, as it lacks the essential characteristic of originality, thus failing to accurately showcase an artist's authentic contributions to the industry. *Qualifications matter more than the method used to create a profile picture* — Tristan Barthel, via [medium.com](https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/ai-profile-pictures-the-secret-to-nailing-your-job-hunt-13fd92949c16)
- The usage of AI in appearances is likely to encounter significant backlash due to its lack of authenticity, which can be readily identified even without specialized tools such as  [GPTZero.me](https://gptzero.me) and [Undetectable.ai](https://undetectable.ai?_by=lumiscape)
- The rapid increase of AI-generated content, especially in the form of songs, on streaming services may result in adverse consequences akin to environmental pollution. Analogous to the harmful impact of dumping plastics into the sea, this practice is discouraged by both industry stakeholders and the AI community.

## Termination Clause:

Soulscape hereby retains the right to take down an artist's releases, severing all communication channels through all available means, and dismissing submissions even if they meet acceptable standards unless a formal apology is extended to Soulscape and its audience. Soulscape reserves the prerogative to report artists involved in unlawful activities, such as copyright infringement or hate speech, to relevant authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.

Soulscape also maintains the authority to initiate legal proceedings against artists who breach these guidelines, particularly in cases involving unauthorized use of copyrighted material or other legal infringements. Legal action may include seeking compensation for any damages incurred by Soulscape due to the artist's actions. Additionally, Soulscape reserves the right to terminate an artist's access to release music through Soulscape and/or receive any earnings from prior releases.

Soulscape may choose to share information about violations with other music platforms, labels, and industry organizations, potentially impacting an artist's prospects within the broader music landscape.

### Appeals Process:

Artists who believe they have been unjustly penalized have the option to appeal Soulscape's decisions by engaging in direct communication with Soulscape and providing supporting evidence. Soulscape will conduct a thorough review of appeals on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the available information and the severity of the violation.

Artists who demonstrate an understanding of their violations, take corrective measures, and express a commitment to adhering to Soulscape's guidelines may be eligible for reinstatement. Decisions regarding reinstatement will be made at the sole discretion of Soulscape, taking into account the nature of the violation, the artist's overall track record, and the potential impact on the Soulscape community.
