# Artist Guidelines
**Some information every Soulscape Artists (or every artist in general) must know**

## 1. Sample & Vocal Usage
You're fine to release an intentionally not copyrighted (better off altered) vocals/sample like from a sample pack or from online resources like **Splice** or from any royalty-free sample packs, rather than using a vocals/sample made intentionally just for a song (if you use it, that would be considered as remix/bootleg and it's NOT acceptable for a release except if it's from our releases AND you have the artist's permission and at least providing us a proof. More on the second paragraph)

You also need to have a license for the vocals/sample, or simply a proof if you have the rights to release it. **If you are using other songs as a sample, ask for a clearance**. For Splice, they could generate the license to use them and send them to the label you wish, an agreement from you and your vocalist, or the proof that you bought the sample pack and the license attached to the pack.

## 2. Artist Appearances 
**Keep your appearance as original as possible**. It's normal for an artist to take their time at least for some weeks for them to make their appearances as good and as original as they possibly can. Cover art, profile pictures, artist galleries, artist descriptions/bios, artist names, logos, their works, performances, and interactions with others are all part of an artist's appearance.

Please refrain from using AI-generated content for your appearances, as it will hurt your name and others in the industry. There's a good chunk of why, but I'll point out some of it:
- You will never know whose content the AI is trained on, and chunks of AI datasets are used without the creator's permission (yes, even OpenAI. \| [PROOF 1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-sued-for-stealing-data-from-the-public-to-train-chatgpt/) \| [PROOF 2](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chatgpt-generative-ai-stole-personal-data-lawsuit-children-medical-2023-6))
- Using AI as your appearance is not acceptable in the first place. As it is not original and does not show your honest work in the industry. *Qualifications matter more than the method used to create a profile picture* — Tristan Barthel, via [medium.com](https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/ai-profile-pictures-the-secret-to-nailing-your-job-hunt-13fd92949c16)
- There will be a ton of backlashes of using AI for professional appearances in the first place, as it will be easily recognizable even without using tools like [GPTZero.me](https://gptzero.me) and [Undetectable.ai](https://undetectable.ai?_by=lumiscape)
- We don't want ourselves to flood our partners' streaming services by using and releasing AI-generated songs to their services. It's like dumping plastics into the sea. Even the AI itself agrees with this, man. "_[It implying] that the unchecked proliferation of AI-generated content could have a detrimental impact on the content landscape_" — OpenAI.

## Termination Clause:

Soulscape hereby retains the right to take down an artist's releases, severing all communication channels through all available means, and dismissing submissions even if they meet acceptable standards unless a formal apology is extended to Soulscape and its audience. Soulscape reserves the prerogative to report artists involved in unlawful activities, such as copyright infringement or hate speech, to relevant authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.

Soulscape also maintains the authority to initiate legal proceedings against artists who breach these guidelines, particularly in cases involving unauthorized use of copyrighted material or other legal infringements. Legal action may include seeking compensation for any damages incurred by Soulscape due to the artist's actions. Additionally, Soulscape reserves the right to terminate an artist's access to release music through Soulscape and/or receive any earnings from prior releases.

Soulscape may choose to share information about violations with other music platforms, labels, and industry organizations, potentially impacting an artist's prospects within the broader music landscape.

### Appeals Process:

Artists who believe they have been unjustly penalized have the option to appeal Soulscape's decisions by engaging in direct communication with Soulscape and providing supporting evidence. Soulscape will conduct a thorough review of appeals on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the available information and the severity of the violation.

Artists who demonstrate an understanding of their violations, take corrective measures, and express a commitment to adhering to Soulscape's guidelines may be eligible for reinstatement. Decisions regarding reinstatement will be made at the sole discretion of Soulscape, taking into account the nature of the violation, the artist's overall track record, and the potential impact on the Soulscape community.
