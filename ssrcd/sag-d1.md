<h1 id="artist-guidelines">Artist Guidelines</h1>
<p><strong>Some information every Soulscape Artists (or every artists in general) must know</strong></p>
<h2 id="sample--vocal-usage">1. Sample &amp; Vocal Usage</h2>
<p>You’re fine to release an intentionally not copyrighted (better off altered) vocals/sample like from a sample pack or from online resources like <strong>Splice</strong> or from any royalty free sample packs, rather than using a vocals/sample made intentionally just for a song (if you use it, that would be considered as remix/bootleg and it’s NOT acceptable for a release except if it’s from our releases AND you have the artist’s permission and at least providing us a proof. More on the second paragraph)</p>
<p>You also need to have a license for the vocals/sample, or simply a proof if you have the rights to release it. <strong>If you are using other songs as a sample, ask for a clearance</strong>. For Splice, they could generate the license to use them and send them to the label you wish, an agreement from you and your vocalist, or the proof that you bought the sample pack and the license attached to the pack.</p>
<h2 id="artist-appearances">2. Artist Appearances</h2>
<p><strong>Keep your appearance as original as possible</strong>. It’s normal for an artist to took their time at least for some weeks for them to make their appearances as good and as original as they possibly can. Cover arts, profile pictures, artist galleries, artist descriptions/bios, artist names, logos, their works, performances, and interactions with others are all part of an artist’s appearances.</p>
<p>Please refrain from using AI generated contents for your appearances, as it will hurt your name and others on the industry. There’s a good chunk of why, but I’ll point some of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will never know whose content the AI is trained on, and chunks of AI datasets is used without the creator’s permission (yes, even OpenAI | <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openai-sued-for-stealing-data-from-the-public-to-train-chatgpt/">PROOF 1</a> | <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chatgpt-generative-ai-stole-personal-data-lawsuit-children-medical-2023-6">PROOF 2</a>)</li>
<li>Using AI as your appearance is not acceptable in the first place. As it is not original, and did not show your honest work in the industry. <em>Qualifications matter more than the method used to create a profile picture</em> — Tristan Barthel, via <a href="https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/ai-profile-pictures-the-secret-to-nailing-your-job-hunt-13fd92949c16">medium.com</a></li>
<li>There will be a ton of backlashes of using AI for professional appearances in the first place, as it will be easily recognisable even without using tools like <a href="https://gptzero.me">GPTZero.me</a> and <a href="https://undetectable.ai?_by=lumiscape">Undetectable.ai</a></li>
</ul>
